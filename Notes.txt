Lighthouse failure/fixes:

gamemap.html - due to the embedded link to an interactive map lighthouse gives failures that can't be fixed from my side.
Lighthouse also tells me to use HTTP/2 for the embedded game map and this is again out of my reach.
It also gives me fixes such as changing the size of my header. The header img has been resized, converted and compressed, it wouldn't look good to resize it even more.

screens.html - due to bigger images and that images sizes aren't specified. Images aren't compressed to the max because I want to keep some of the quality.
Images size would be something to fix in future.
